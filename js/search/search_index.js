dataset, default to any.\nThis object must be build from the data operations module, never to be instantiated directly.\nExample\n```typescript\n\nimport { jexiaClient, dataOperations } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\nconst dataModule = dataOperations();\n\njexiaClient().init(credentials, dataModule);\n\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n.select()\n.execute()\n.then((data) => {\n// you have been succesfully logged in!\n// you can start using the dataModule variable to operate on records here\n}).catch((error) => {\n// uh-oh, there was a problem logging in, check the error.message for more info\n});\n```\n\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Example\n            \n            \n            \n\n            \n    Index\n    \n        \n                \n

Guide\nFirst please read and abide by the Code of Conduct.\nEnvironment\nEverything you need is a stable version of Node.JS (v8+).\nCoding Style Guidelines\nThe source code is written in TypeScript using strict compilation mode and all the ES2017 features. We are following the TSLint and Editorconfig rules listed at their config files. We strongly recommend to use a code editor with good support for these tools (we recommend VSCode), so that it is easy to integrate new code into our code base.\nFirst Run\nAfter cloning the project and installing the dependencies with npm install you should be able start coding.\nYou can double check if the local environment is fully working by running the tests with npm test and building the project with npm run build.\nMain Development Commands\nExecute unit tests and check coverage:\n\nnpm test\n\nExecute unit tests in watch mode for TDD purposes:\n\nnpm run tdd\n\nLint Typescript code:\n\nnpm run lint\n\nCommit convention helper (see related topic below):\n\nnpm run commit\n\nGenerate API reference documentation locally:\n\nnpm run docs\n\nBuild the project locally:\n\nnpm run build\n\nCommit Message Format\nThis repository follows a strict Commit Message Conventions, which leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. Also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log, calculate the new version number and automatically publish new versions to NPM. For these purposes, we are using Semantic Release. We have a helper script npm run commit that provides a command line based wizard for easy commit message formatting.\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nOnly the first line is mandatory, and any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! A linter will check your commit message in a git hook for each commit and guide you to fix any error. Please take a look at the AngularJS Commit Message Conventions for detailed information about this convention.\nSubmitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch our repository for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\nFork the project on Github\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, following code style guidelines, and including appropriate test cases.\n\nRun the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.\n\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message format:\n   npm run commit\nPush your branch to your GitHub fork:\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to jexia-sdk-js:master.\n\nCheck if our Continuous Integration checks passed against your PR and make the necessary fixes if something breaks.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nPlease apply the required updates.\n\nRe-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n\nRe-run performance tests to make sure your changes didn't hurt performance.\n\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it!

Datasets and Filesets (CRUD operations, file uploads)\nAuthentication and authorization under the platform, you only need to provide your credentials.\n\nCurrently SDK is focused on consuming data. In order to manage data schema (creating Datasets, adding fields to them, etc.) you need to use our web application. We suggest you read the guide Start your first project.\nOn-demand data access\nThe user can execute the following operations on records:\n\nCREATE\nREAD\nUPDATE\nDELETE\n\nExecuting an operation on a set of records is done through a Query. Depending on their type, Queries give the user access to some (or all) of the following options:\n\nFiltering (only records satisfying a certain condition will be retrieved/affected)\nSorting (the records will be sorted by a rule and direction before the action is executed)\nLimiting/offsetting (only a certain number of records, starting from a certain position in the Dataset will be affected)\nSelecting the fields to be retrieved (when the user does not want the entire record to be retrieved, only certain columns)\n\nImportant to notice that all these features are handled server-side.\nCode samples\nPlease keep in mind that this quick start guide uses ECMAScript 8 or sometimes TypeScript syntaxes.\nThe examples are made with a simple data schema in mind: think a basic social media platform where users can write posts and/or comments to posts. A post can be related to any number of comments, while each post and each comment has a user as author.\nImporting the SDK into your JS project\nIn a NodeJS application:\nimport { jexiaClient } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";In the browser:\nimport { jexiaClient } from \"jexia-sdk-js/browser\";Initialization and Authentication\nThe jexiaClient() function will return a Promise of the Client class. You can provide a custom fetch standard compliant function as a parameter, as default we are using node-fetch package at NodeJS, and the native browser's fetch implementation.\nimport { Client } from \"jexia-sdk-js\";\nimport { jexiaClient } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\nconst clientPromise: Promise = jexiaClient()\n  .init({\n    projectID: \"\",\n    key: \"\",\n    secret: \"\",\n  });\n\nclientPromise.then((client: Client) => {\n  // you have been succesfully logged in!\n}).catch((error: Error) => {\n  // uh-oh, there was a problem logging in, check error.message for more info\n});The Module system\nJexia SDK is built as a set of modules structured around a core entity (the Client class used above).\nIn order to use a module you need to:\n\nInitialize it\nPass it to the Client when calling the .init() method\n\nThe example below will show how to initialize SDK using Datasets Module. The modules await the client initialization before make any operations, so you don't need to manually await for client's initialization Promise.\nimport { jexiaClient, dataOperations } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\nconst dataModule = dataOperations();\njexiaClient().init(credentials, dataModule);\n\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .execute()\n  .then(data => {\n    // you have been succesfully logged in!\n    // you can start using the dataModule variable to operate on records here\n  }).catch(error => {\n    // uh-oh, there was a problem logging in, check the error.message for more info\n  });Logging off and cleanup\nThe Client class exposes a method called .terminate(). Use this to clear up resources used by the Client and any modules you initialized along with it (Client will terminate any modules you supplied on initialization, so you don't have to pass them.)\n[..]\nclient\n  .terminate()\n  .then(terminatedClient => {\n    // everything has been cleared\n  }).catch(error => {\n    // something went wrong when cleaning up\n  });\n[..]\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/typescript-features.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/typescript-features.html","title":"additional-page - TypeScript Features","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nTypeScript Features\nThe JS SDK is written in TypeScript, even through it is transpiled to pure JavaScript, we also publish the Type Definitions, so TypeScript users can enjoy some extra features out of the box, without install or configure anything else.\nTyped Datasets\nDatasets accepts your type/interface definition (otherwise defaults to any). See example below:\ninterface Post {\n  title: string;\n  published: boolean;\n}\n\nconst posts: Dataset = dom.dataset(\"posts\");Fields Validation\nFor each query method that receives field names, such as .fields(\"title\") or .sortAsc(\"title\"), typescript compiler will validate if they field exists at the given interface, or if it is a default filed name, resulting in a compilation error if any of the given field names were not found.\n\nTyped Query Results\nAll the results of your queries will automatically use the given interface, without the need to manually type it.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/code-of-conduct.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/code-of-conduct.html","title":"additional-page - Code of Conduct","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nContributor Covenant Code of Conduct\nOur Pledge\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\ncontributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and\nour community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,\nnationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and\norientation.\nOur Standards\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for the community\nShowing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\naddress, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\nprofessional setting\n\nOur Responsibilities\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions\nthat are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or\npermanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\nScope\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community.

You are able to manipulate this data by creating, updating, fetching and deleting records and also to query over them by using conditions like isEqualTo and isGreaterThen (full list available in FieldFilter API reference).\nInitialize\nTo use dataset features, just add dataOperations module to the client initialization. Notice that when your application runs in NodeJS, you should import dataOperations from jexia-sdk-js/node and from jexia-sdk-js/browser when it runs in a browser.\nimport { jexiaClient, dataOperations } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\"; // \"jexia-sdk-js/browser\" for browser applications\nconst dataModule = dataOperations();\n\njexiaClient().init({\n  projectID: \"\",\n  key: \"\",\n  secret: \"\",\n}, dataModule);Getting a dataset object\nDataset object can be received from the dataModule just by its name:\nconst myDataset = dataModule.dataset(\"my_dataset\");It is also possible to get a list of datasets at a time:\nconst [posts, authors] = dataModule.datasets([\"posts\", \"authors\"]);Obtained object has all the methods to manage its data - insert, select, update and delete:\nconst selectQuery = myDataset.select();\nconst insertQuery = myDataset.insert([post1, post2]);\nconst updateQuery = myDataset.update([{ title: \"Updated title\" }]);\nconst deleteQuery = myDataset.delete();These methods return an Observable and allow you to use all the power of RxJS library (RxJs documentation).\nLet's write something interesting. For example, we want to select records older than 1 day and put them into archive:\n// datasets\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nconst archive = dataModule.dataset(\"archive\");\n\n// Calculate yesterday's date\nconst date = new Date();\ndate.setDate(date.getDate() - 1);\nconst yesterday = date.toISOString();\n\nposts.select()\n  // get all records that had been created earlier than yesterday\n  .where(field => field(\"created_at\").isLessThan(yesterday))\n  .pipe(\n    // put them into archive!\n    switchMap(records => archive.insert(records)),\n  )\n  .subscribe();Pay attention that request to the dataset will not be sent until subscribe() method is called.\nLet's have a look at each method.\nInserting records\nRecords can be inserted to a dataset either by sending an array or a single object. The response will always be an array though.\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nconst insertQuery = posts.insert([\n { title: \"New Post\", content: \"content here\" },\n { title: \"Another Post\", content: \"some more content\" }\n]);\n\n// At this point nothing has happened yet\n// we need to call subscribe in order to run a query\ninsertQuery.subscribe();\n\n// Single record\nconst insertQuery = posts.insert({\n title: \"New Post\",\n content: \"content here\"\n}).subscribe();\n\n// Either way, the response will be an array\ninsertQuery.subscribe(records => {\n     // you will always get an array of created records, including their generated IDs (even when inserting a single record)\n  },\n  error => {\n     // you can see the error info here, if something goes wrong\n});Updating records\nThe update method is used to modify records, it always has to be used with the .where method and a filter criteria.\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts\n  .update({ title: \"Same title for tom and harry posts\" })\n  .where(field => field(\"author_name\").isInArray([\"Tom\", \"Harry\"]))\n  .subscribe(affectedRecords => {\n   /* [{ title: \"Same title for tom and harry posts\", author_name: \"Tom\" },\n       { title: \"Same title for tom and harry posts\", author_name: \"Tom\" },\n       { title: \"Same title for tom and harry posts\", author_name: \"Harry\" },\n       { title: \"Same title for tom and harry posts\", author_name: \"Tom\" }]\n    */\n  });Deleting records\n Deleting  also requires at least one condition:\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts\n  .delete()\n  .where(field => field(\"title\").isLike(\"%test%\"))\n  .subscribe(deletedFields => {\n    // you will be able to access the deleted posts here\n    // they are not stored in the DB anymore, but maybe you\n    // want to display a visual confirmation of what was deleted\n  });Query records\nQuery object, returned by select() method, has an ability to filter, order, limit and offset records. These methods have to be called in chain before subscribe().\nOur first query: selecting all records in a dataset\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .subscribe(\n    records => {\n      // here are all your posts\n    },\n    error => {\n      // some error happened\n    }\n  );Sorting records\nIn order to sort records, you need to call .sortAsc or .sortDesc on a Query object and pass the name of the field you want to sort by.\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts\n  .select()\n  .sortAsc(\"created_at\")\n  .subscribe(records => {\n    // you've got sorted records here\n  });Limit and offset\nYou can use .limit and .offset on a Query to paginate your records. They can be used separately or together. Only setting the limit (to a value X) will make the query operate on the first X records. Only setting the offset will make the query operate on the last Y records, starting from the offset value.\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .limit(2)\n  .offset(5)\n  .subscribe(records => // paginatedPosts will be an array of 2 records, starting from position 5);Only retrieving certain fields\nYou can use .fields method to restrict fields you want to retrieve.\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .fields(\"title\", \"author\") // you can also pass an array of field names\n  .subscribe(records => // you will get array of {id, title, author} records (id is always returned));Aggregation functions\nThere are a few aggregation functions you are able to use in order to do some calculations before obtaining data:\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .fields({ fn: \"count\", field: \"*\" })\n  .subscribe(result => {\n    /* the result is an array with one record (let's say we have 5 posts):\n       [{\n          count: 5\n       }]\n     */\n  });You can provide an alias to make result more readable (using aliases is the only way to get proper results if you want to query two or more the same aggregation functions in one query):\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .fields({ fn: \"max\", field: \"likes\": alias: \"likes\" })\n  .subscribe(result => {\n    /* the result is:\n       [\n         { \"likes\": 24 },\n       ]\n     */\n  });You can also use any sets of plain fields and functions. Let's calculate the maximum of likes each author has received:\nconst posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n\nposts.select()\n  .fields(\"author\", { fn: \"max\", field: \"likes\" })\n  .subscribe(result => {\n    /* the result is:\n       [\n         { author: \"Tom\", \"max\": 10 },\n         { author: \"Harry\", \"max\": 24 },\n       ]\n     */\n  });The full list of available aggregation functions:\n\nmax\nmin\nsum\navg\ncount\n\nFiltering records\nYou can use the filtering to select what records a certain query will operate on.\nIn order to define a filter, you can use the exposed method field.\nimport { field } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\nconst isAuthorTom = field(\"author_name\").isEqualTo(\"Tom\");\nconst isAuthorDick = field(\"author_name\").isEqualTo(\"Dick\");\nconst isAuthorTomOrDick = isAuthorTom.or(isAuthorDick);\n\n// In order to use these conditions, they need to be added to a query through `.where` method\n\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n .select()\n .where(isAuthorTomOrDick)\n .subscribe(records => // posts of Tom and Dick);If you prefer, .where method also accepts a lazy callback, that receives the field method received as an argument:\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n .select()\n .where(field => field(\"author_name\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\"));Multiple .where calls can be chained, but only the last call will be taken into account. If a complex condition needs to be set for filtering, it has to be created in one go (in-line or not) and passed as an argument to the .where method.\nFiltering conditions can be nested at any level.\n// Filtering in a flat way\nconst isPostedByTomAndIsAboutSports = field(\"author_name\")\n .isEqualTo(\"Tom\").and(field(\"title\").isLike(\"sports\"));\n\n// Filtering with one nested level\nconst isPostedByDickAndIsAboutMusic = field(\"author_name\")\n .isEqualTo(\"Dick\").and(field(\"title\").isLike(\"music\"));\n\nconst isTomOrIsDickHarry = field(\"author_name\")\n .isEqualTo(\"Tom\").or( isPostedByDickAndIsAboutMusic // nested level );\n\n// Filtering with multiple nested levels\nconst isAuthorDutch = field(\"author_country\").isEqualTo(\"NL\");\nconst isKidOrSenior = field(\"author_age\")\n .isGreaterThan(64).or(field(\"author_age\").isLessThan(16));\nconst isTomAndIsDuthOrKidOrSenior = field(\"first_name\")\n .isEqualTo(\"Tom\").and( isAuthorDutch.or(isKidOrSenior) );Filtering operator list and examples\nYou can find a complete list of the operators supported for filtering in the FieldFilter API reference.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/fileset-operations.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/fileset-operations.html","title":"additional-page - Fileset Operations","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nJexia Fileset Module (JFS)\nJFS is used for uploading, fetching and manipulating files as any other user data. Basically, fileset is a dataset, \nbut provides a way to maintain large data objects (files).Before uploading any file you need to manually create a fileset with\nWeb Management Application.\nYou can also set AWS bucket and credentials so that your files will be automatically uploaded to your Amazon storage.\nInitialize\nTo use fileset features, just add fileOperations module to the client initialization. Notice, that for Node.js\nyou have to import fileOperations from jexia-sdk-js/node, but if you running your application in browser you need to\nuse jexia-sdk-js/browser path. It's because file format is different under these two platforms.\nimport { jexiaClient, fileOperations } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\"; // \"jexia-sdk-js/browser\" for browser applications\n\nconst jfs = fileOperations();\n\njexiaClient().init({\n  projectID: \"your-project-id\",  \n  key: \"your-api-key\",  \n  secret: \"your-api-secret\"  \n}, jfs);Configure module\nYou can pass a config object to the fileOperation() function:\nconst jfs = fileOperations({\n  /* Use RTC module to subscribe for the fileset events and wait until file\n     will be successfully uploaded. Needs RTC module to be activated\n     default: false */\n  uploadWaitForCompleted: boolean,\n  /* Timeout for uploading files\n     default: 120000 */\n  uploadTimeout: number\n});Files format\nUnder Node.js jfs accepts read stream, \nwhich can be created with fs.createReadStream(path). \nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst record = {\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\"../assets/logo.png\")\n}In browser you need to pass Blob returned by  (part of HTML5 File Api).\nconst fileInput = document.getElementById(\"file-input\");\nfileInput.addEventListener(\"change\", event => {\n  const record = {\n    file: event.target.files[0]\n  }\n}Custom fileset fields\nYou can also send any additional fields alongside with a file and they will be stored in a fileset. \nJust use data property:\nconst record = {\n  data: {\n    description: \"Main company logo\",\n    useByDefault: true\n  },\n  file\n}Upload a file to the fileset\nIf you already set up a fileset, you are able to upload files. One or multiple files can be uploaded at once. upload() \nreturns an observable and you need to call subscribe() to start uploading process. Each uploaded file will emit a \nfileRecord, which contains id and status. of uploaded file.\njfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\").upload([\n  record1, record2, ...\n]).subscribe(fileRecord => {\n   console.log(fileRecord);\n   /* output:\n   { id: \"11a12f17-8367-4114-a588-ae98a6cb3cda\",\n      created_at: \"2019-05-24T07:17:37.325882Z\",\n      updated_at: \"2019-05-24T07:17:37.325882Z\",\n      name: null,\n      size: null,\n      type: null,\n      url: null,\n      status: \"in_progress\" }\n    */\n});File upload status\nAfter you upload a file you will receive file status. Status displays the progress of file uploading. \nPossible values are: \n\nin_progress \n\ncompleted\n\nfailed \nThe first status you will get in response from upload() is in_progress (if you did not set true to the \nsubscribeForTheFileUploading config property). It means that file record has been created and currently file is \nuploading to the persistent storage (whether AWS bucket or something else). \nThere are two ways to track further file status changes:\n\nsubscribe to the fileset changes with realTimeModule. When your file is to be successfully uploaded \nyou will get completed status (or error if something goes wrong).\n\nset uploadWaitForCompleted config option and SDK will wait for the completed status automatically.\n\n\nUse realTimeModule:\nimport { jexiaClient, fileOperations, realTime } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\nconst jfs = fileOperations();\n\njexiaClient().init({\n  projectID: \"your-project-id\",\n  key: \"your-project-key\",\n  secret: \"your-project-secret\"\n}, jfs, realTime());\n\nconst fileset = jfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\");\n\nconst records = [{\n  data: {\n    description: \"just a file\"\n  },\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\"../assets/logo.png\")\n}];\n\nfileset.upload(records).pipe(\n  concatMap(fileRecord => fileset.watch().pipe(\n    filter(event => event.data[0].id === fileRecord.id),\n    takeWhile(event => event.data[0].status !== \"completed\", true),\n    map(event => {\n      fileRecord.status = event.data[0].status;\n      return fileRecord;\n    })\n  ))\n).subscribe();As you can see, there are some details you should take care of: filtering events by record id (watch() returns \nall events from the fileset), unsubscribing from watch observable with takeWhile. Better to use the next option.\nUse uploadWaitForCompleted config property (notice that you still need to activate realTimeModule):\nimport { jexiaClient, fileOperations, realTime } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\nimport * as fs from \"fs\";\n\nconst jfs = fileOperations({\n  uploadWaitForCompleted: true    \n});\n\njexiaClient().init({\n  projectID: \"your-project-id\",\n  key: \"your-project-key\",\n  secret: \"your-project-secret\"\n}, jfs, realTime());\n\nconst fileset = jfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\");\n\nconst records = [{\n  data: {\n    description: \"just a file\"\n  },\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\"../assets/logo.png\")\n}];\n\nfileset.upload(records).subscribe(fileRecord => {\n  console.log(fileRecord);\n  /* output:\n    { id: \"11a12f17-8367-4114-a588-ae98a6cb3cda\",\n      created_at: \"2019-05-24T07:17:37.325882Z\",\n      updated_at: \"2019-05-24T07:18:40.455764Z\",\n      name: \"logo.png\",\n      size: 42341,\n      type: \"png\",\n      url: \"https://...\",\n      status: \"completed\" }\n  */\n});Fileset CRUD operations\nIt's possible to query filesets in the same way as datasets, except insert query - you need to use upload() instead.All fileset records are basically FileRecords, they have additional fields, such as name, size, url, etc.These fields, as well as any custom fields, can be used for select queries (but you cannot update them).  \nSelect query\njfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\")  \n .select(\"name\", \"url\")  \n .where(field => field(\"size\").isGreaterThan(1024000))  \n .subscribe();  \n\n// array of files that fit to the condition will be returned  \n// files === [{ name: \"file1.jpj\", url: \"https://...\" }, {...}, ...]  Update query\nUpdate fileset in the same way as dataset. Updating a fileset record with new file is not supported.\njfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\")  \n .update({ \"isDefaultImage\": false })  \n .where(field => field(\"name\").isEqualTo(\"companyLogo.png\"))\n .subscribe();  Delete query\njfs.fileset(\"fileset_name\")  \n .delete()  \n .where(field => field(\"size\").isGreaterThan(1024000))  \n .subscribe();  \n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/user-management-system.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/user-management-system.html","title":"additional-page - User Management System","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nJexia User Management System Module (UMS)\nUMS provides an ability to manage user accounts, sign-up and sign-in to the Jexia project with these accounts and perform  data changes with permissions of any authorized user. There are two ways to create a new user:   \n\nYou can use Web Management Application and create  users one by one with nice UI.   \nYou can use signup() method of User Management Module  \n\nReturn values\nSome of the methods of this module such as select(), update() and delete() return observable, but other return Promise type. This might be changed soon and all methods will return an observable.  \nInitialize\nIf you want to use UMS module, just add it to the Jexia Client initialization:  \nimport { jexiaClient, UMSModule } from \"jexia-sdk-js\";  \n\nconst ums = new UMSModule();   \njexiaClient().init({    \n  projectID: \"your-project-id\",    \n  key: \"your-api-key\",    \nsecret: \"your-api-secret\" }, ums);  If you are going to use UMS authorization, you can omit key/secret options, but this requires UMS signing in before making any data request:  \njexiaClient().init({    \n projectID: \"your-project-id\"  \n}, ums); Sign-in user to the Jexia project\nUMS uses email and password as user credentials. User account should exist in a project.Additional options (both are optional):  \n\ndefaultif true, this user account will be used for all further data operations by default  \naliasaccount alias. You can use it to clarify which account is going to be used to perform data operation  \n\nconst user = await ums.signIn({    \n  email: 'Elon@tesla.com',    \n  password: 'secret-password',    \n  default: false,   \n  alias: 'Elon Musk'  \n});  Perform data operation on behalf of a user\nIf user successfully signed in, his alias can be used to get access to the datasets, filesets or any other project data.You can also use user's email as an alias or, if default option was set to true, do not specify alias at all.  \nUse alias:     \ndom.dataset('rockets', 'Elon Mask').select();   Use email:  \ndom.dataset('rockets', 'Elon@tesla.com').select(); Omit alias, default user will be used.:  \nums.signIn({    \n  email: 'Elon@tesla.com',    \n  password: 'secret-password',    \n  default: true  \n});   \ndom.dataset('rockets').select(); Set default user\nYou can set default user with setDefault() method. After this all data operations will use Elon's permissions:  \nums.setDefault('Elon Musk'); Reset authorization\nWith resetDefault() method you can switch back to default project authorization. Usually it is apiKey auth:  \nums.resetDefault();  Create a new user (Sign-up)\nYou can sign up a new user to the project.  \nconst user = await ums.signUp({    \n  email: \"robert@company.com\",    \n  password: \"qwert1234\" \n});  \n\n/* returned user: \n{  \n id: \"005c8679-3fad-46fd-a93f-9484ea8ff738\",\n email: \"robert@company.com\", \n active: true, \n created_at: \"2017-12-31T23:59:59.123456Z\", \n updated_at: \"2017-12-31T23:59:59.123456Z\"\n} */  You can also pass an extra fields during sing-up. These fields will be saved in the UMS and you can receive them by\n\"getUser()\" method:\nconst user = await ums.signUp(\n  { email: \"john@company.com\", password: \"rewq4321\" },\n  { \n    age: 25, \n    address: { \n      city: \"Apeldoorn\",\n      country: \"NL\"\n    }\n  }\n);\n\n/* returned user:\n{\n    \"active\": true,\n    \"address\": {\n        \"city\": \"Apeldoorn\",\n        \"country\": \"NL\"\n    },\n    \"age\": 25,\n    \"created_at\": \"2020-02-12T11:09:36.017824Z\",\n    \"email\": \"john@company.com\",\n    \"id\": \"736afb7d-fbc2-4ef2-9ffe-bbdc454e68a3\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2020-02-12T11:09:36.017824Z\"\n} */Fetch user by alias alias (or email)\n const user = await ums.getUser('Elon Musk'); Change user password\nums.changePassword('Elon@tesla.com', oldPassword, newPassword); Delete user\nYou need to provide current user password to delete account:  \nums.deleteUser('Elon@tesla.com', password); Manage user\nIt is also possible to use CRUD methods select(), update() and delete(). They have the same syntax  and return values as corresponding data operations methods.All these methods return observables.To get more information see Dataset Module Documentation  \nExamples:  \n// select all active users  \nums.select()  \n .where(field => field(\"active\").isEqualTo(true))  \n .subscribe();  // suspend Elon!  \nums.update({ active: false })  \n .where(field => field(\"email\").isEqualTo(\"Elon@tesla.com\"))  \n .subscribe();  // delete all suspended users  \nums.delete()  \n .where(field => field(\"active\").isEqualTo(false))  \n .subscribe();  Change/reset user password\nUser's password can be changed whether the current password is known by calling:\nums.changePassword('Elon@tesla.com', currentPassword, newPassword);When the current password isn't known, you need to request a password reset:\nums.requestResetPassword('Elon@tesla.com');If provided email is valid and exists the user will receive an e-mail with instructions to reset their password. This e-mail will include a reset token, that should be used to reset his password:\nums.resetPassword(receivedResetToken, newPassword);\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/relations.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/relations.html","title":"additional-page - Relations","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nRelations\nAll project resources can be related to each other and SDK supports inserting, fetching and attaching/detaching related\nrecords.\nLet's create a simple schema which will be used for all further examples:\n\nThere are three datasets and two relations: posts has one-2-many relation to comments and comments has\none-2-one relation to author (remember that all management opearations, such as creating datasets, fields and\nrelations can be done with Web Management Application only).\nTo make our datasets not so boring, we can also add a few fields:\ninterface Author {\n  email: string;\n}\ninterface Comment {\n  text: string;\n  like: boolean;\n  author: Author;\n}\ninterface Post {\n  title: string;\n  message: string;\n  comments: Comment[];\n}Pay your attention - Post includes comments field as an array, but Comment has an author\nas a plain value. That's the difference between one-2-many and one-2-one relation types.\nInsert data\nTo insert related records just provide a nested array to the .insert() method:\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .insert([{\n    title: \"Relations with Jexia SDK\",\n    message: \"A do like how Jexia SDK implements relations!\",\n    comments: [{\n      text: \"Me too!\",\n      like: true,\n      author: { email: \"customer@email.com\" }\n    }, {\n      text: \"Might've been a bit better :(\",\n      like: false,\n      author: { email: \"hater@yahoo.com\" }\n    }]\n  }])\n  .subscribe();Notice that records should be inserted in appropriate order - the relation root must be insert root.\nIt's impossible to insert into comment dataset with post related to that comment (tree cannot grow upside down).\nThis example is not going to work:\ndom.dataset(\"comments\")\n  .insert([{\n    text: \"Me too!\",\n    like: true,\n    posts: {\n      title: \"Relations with Jexia SDK\",\n      message: \"A do like how Jexia SDK implements relations!\"\n    }\n  }])\n  .subscribe();If you want to create a comment in the existent post, you need to use .attach(), see how to use it in\nAttach and detach records.\nAlso look how we are using arrays for one-2-many posts -> comments relation and just an object\nfor the comments -> author one-2-one relation.\nFetching related records\nBy default, .select() operation does not include related resources. To make it doing that we need to use .related()\nmethod:\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .related(\"comments\")\n  .subscribe(postsWithComments => {\n    console.log(postsWithComments);\n  });\n// [\n//   {\n//     id: ...\n//     created_at: ...\n//     updated_at: ...\n//     title: \"Relations with Jexia SDK\",\n//     message: \"A do like how Jexia SDK implements relations!\",\n//     comments: [\n//       {\n//         id: ...\n//         created_at: ...\n//         updated_at: ...\n//         text: \"Me too!\",\n//         like: true,\n//       },\n//       {\n//         id: ...\n//         created_at: ...\n//         updated_at: ...\n//         text: \"Might've been a bit better :(\",\n//         like: false,\n//       }\n//     ]\n//   }\n// ]We can also want to get not all fields but only few:\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .related(\"comments\", comments => comments.fields(\"text\"))\n  .subscribe(postsWithCommentsText => {\n    console.log(postsWithCommentsText);\n  });\n// [\n//   {\n//     id: ...\n//     created_at: ...\n//     updated_at: ...\n//     title: \"Relations with Jexia SDK\",\n//     message: \"A do like how Jexia SDK implements relations!\",\n//     comments: [\n//       {\n//         id: ...\n//         text: \"Me too!\",\n//       },\n//       {\n//         id: ...\n//         text: \"Might've been a bit better :(\",\n//       }\n//     ]\n//   }\n// ]Notice that id field will be always there. Nothing will be working without id!\nWhat if we want to get an author of each comment? Simple, just use nested .related():\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .related(\"comments\", comments => comments.related(\"author\"))\n  .subscribe()Of course, you can use as many nested relations as you want and select any fields from any resource:\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .related(\"comments\", comments => comments\n    .fields(\"text\", \"like\")\n    .related(\"author\"), author => author\n      .fields(\"email\")\n    )\n  )\n  .subscribe()Attach and detach records\nWe have described how to insert parent and child records in one go, but eventually, we need to relate existent records\nto other ones. You can do it using .attach() and .detach().\nLet's say you have inserted a post:\n  const posts = await dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .insert({\n      title: \"A post with no comments\",\n      message: \"Okay\",\n    })\n    .toPromise();\n\n  console.log(posts);\n  // [\n  //   {\n  //     id: ...,\n  //     title: \"A post with no comments\",\n  //     message: \"Okay\",\n  //   }\n  // ]Then some comments...\n  const comments = await dom.dataset(\"comments\")\n    .insert([\n      {\n        text: \"Very nice, congrats!\",\n        like: true,\n      },\n      {\n        text: \"Might've been waaaay better\",\n        like: false,\n      },\n    ])\n    .toPromise();\n\n  console.log(comments);\n  // [\n  //   { id: ..., text: \"Very nice, congrats!\", like: true },\n  //   { id: ..., text: \"Might've been waaaay better\", like: false }\n  // ]\n\nFinally, you want to relate these with your post, so you call .attach() passing the name of the resource (that can\nbe either a dataset or a fileset) and a second argument, a filter that will restrict the operation.\nAvailable ways to filter attach/detach operation:\n  // an array of entities containing their id\n  dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .attach(\"comments\", [\n      {\n        id: \"b4961b6a-85a2-4ee8-b946-9001c978c801\",\n        text: \"Very nice, congrats!\",\n      },\n      {\n        id: \"e199d460-c88f-4ab9-8373-1d6ad0bd0acb\",\n        text: \"Might've been waaaay better\",\n      },\n    ])\n    .subscribe();\n\n  // an array of ids\n  dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .attach(\"comments\", [\n      \"b4961b6a-85a2-4ee8-b946-9001c978c801\",\n      \"e199d460-c88f-4ab9-8373-1d6ad0bd0acb\",\n    ])\n    .subscribe();\n\nOr even using filter criterion (More details in Filtering records):\n  // a callback that will receive \"field\" function\n  dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .attach(\"comments\", field => field(\"id\").isInArray(commentsIds))\n    .subscribe();\n\n  // an exposed \"field\" function\n  dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .attach(\"comments\", field(\"id\").isInArray(commentsIds))\n    .subscribe();\n\nFull example using a callback:\n  const firstPost = posts[0];\n  const commentsIds = comments.map(comment => comment.id);\n\n  await dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .attach(\"comments\", field => field(\"id\").isInArray(commentsIds))\n    .where(field => field(\"id\").isEqualTo(firstPost.id)) // required for both attach/detach, otherwise an error will be thrown\n    .toPromise();\n\n  // attach operation doesn't return any data, so we need to call .select()\n  const postsWithComments = await dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .select()\n    .related(\"comments\")\n    .toPromise();\n\n  console.log(postsWithComments);\n  // [\n  //   {\n  //     id: ...,\n  //     title: \"A post with no comments\",\n  //     message: \"Okay\",\n  //     comments: [\n  //       { id: ..., text: \"Very nice, congrats!\", like: true },\n  //       { id: ..., text: \"Might've been waaaay better\", like: false }\n  //     ]\n  //   }\n  // ]\n\nAfter attaching those comments, you feel regret, and you want to undo it. That's totally acceptable,\nsimilar to .attach(), call .detach():\n  await dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .detach(\"comments\", field => field(\"like\").isEqualTo(false)) // detach comments with unlike from the post\n    .where(field => field(\"id\").isEqualTo(firstPost.id))\n    .toPromise();\n\n  const postsWithNoUnlikeComments = await dom.dataset(\"posts\")\n    .select()\n    .related(\"comments\")\n    .toPromise();\n\n  console.log(postsWithNoUnlikeComments);\n  // [\n  //   {\n  //     id: ...,\n  //     title: \"A post with no comments\",\n  //     message: \"Okay\",\n  //     comments: [\n  //       { id: ..., text: \"Very nice, congrats!\", like: true }\n  //     ]\n  //   }\n  // ]Take advantage from the TS interfaces\nWe have created typescript interfaces for our datasets. Why? Well, it can give us some useful hints,\nespecially when we are working on a big, complex query. Let's see how it works.\nAll we need to do to turn on typescript magic it's just provide an interface when we are initializing a query:\ndom.dataset(\"posts\")\n  select()\n  ...Now we've got hint for the .related() method:\n\nand hint for the nested fields:\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/real-time-operations.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/real-time-operations.html","title":"additional-page - Real Time Operations","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nReal Time Module Documentation\nThe SDK supports real time notifications about CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE operations on DataSets using Observable.\nInitialize RealTime Module\nTo use real time notifications, RealTimeModule has to be initialized alongside with DataOperationsModule:\n// import dependencies from jexia SDK bundle\nimport { jexiaClient, dataOperations, realTime } from \"jexia-sdk-js/node\";\n\n// Initialize DataOperationsModule\nconst dataModule = dataOperations();\n\n// initialize jexia client\njexiaClient().init(credentials, dataModule, realTime());Subscribe for notifications\nNow you can use watch() method to subscribe for notifications. Actions can be provided either as arguments or\nas an array.\nAllowed values are:\n\ncreated\nupdated\ndeleted\nall (used by default)\n\nHere is an example of usage:\nconst subscription = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .watch(\"created\", \"deleted\")\n  .subscribe(messageObject => {\n    console.log(\"Realtime message received:\", messageObject.data);\n  }, error => {\n    console.log(error);\n  });Unsubscribe from notifications\nJust use default observable api to unsubscribe from notifications. \nsubscription.unsubscribe();\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/real-time-operations/communication-with-channels.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/real-time-operations/communication-with-channels.html","title":"additional-page - Communication with channels","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCommunication with channels\nClient-side applications can communicate with each other in real-time using channels which basically, allows sending and receiving messages through websocket. \nBefore using this feature, you need to create at least one channel and an appropriate policy with allowed \"publish\" and \"subscribe\" actions. Channels can be managed with Jexia Web Management Application.  \nWhen an application sends a message to the channel, everyone subscribed to that channel immediately receives it. If the persistent store is activated for the channel (using management application), it is also possible to get messaging history.\nFor more information about channels management, message size limitations and so, please read the official Jexia documentation page.  \nInitialize\nTo use real-time communication initialize Jexia client with the real-time module:  \nimport { jexiaClient, realTime } from \"jexia-sdk-js\";  \n\nconst rtm = realTime();  \n\njexiaClient().init({  \n  projectID: \"your-project-id\",  \n  key: \"your-api-key\",    \n  secret: \"your-api-secret\"  \n}, rtm);  Then you can get your channel object (considered that channel has been already created in management application, otherwise an error will be thrown, see \"Handling errors\" below):\nconst channel = rtm.channel(\"my_channel\");Subscribe to the channel events\nBasically, channel object is inherited from the RxJS Observable, so just use subscribe() method: \nchannel.subscribe(message => {\n  // you received a message here!\n});You can use .pipe() and any RxJS operators to have more flexibility:\nchannel.pipe(\n  filter(message => message.from === user.id), // filter only specific user\n  pluck(\"data\") // pull out only data field \n).subscribe(data => {\n  // you've got data from the specific user here!\n});Unsubscribe\n Don't forget to unsubscribe in case there is no needs to get messages from the channel anymore, just the use default RxJS unsubscribe() method:\n const subscription = channel.subscribe();\nsubscription.unsubscribe();Publish to the channel\nYou can publish any valid JSON type to the channel. Here is publishing a string example:\nconst message = \"Hey bro, did you feed our home rhino?\";  \nchannel.publish(message); It is also can be an object:\nchannel.publish({\n  product: \"apple\",\n  amount: 42\n});  Get the message history\nchannel.getLog().subscribe(log => {\n  // you will receive an array of all the messages here (see schema below)\n});  It is also possible to use filters:\n// load messages from the specific user\nchannel.getLog(field => field(\"sender_id\").isEqualTo(user.id));Stored message schema\n[{\n  id: string, // uuid \n  sender_id: string, // uuid \n  sender_type: string, // either \"apk\" or \"ums\",\n  created_at: string, // Date in ISO format \n  updated_at: string, // Date in ISO format\n  data: any,\n}, {...}, ...]Errors handling\nSome errors can happen during communications - channel might have not been created, a policy was incorrect or network troubles could occur. Any of those errors will be thrown from the observable and could be caught with the error handler.\nIn this example there is no such channel:\nrtm.channel(\"my_camel\").subscribe(\n  message => {\n    console.log(message); // we've got a message from the channel\n  },\n  error => {\n    console.log(error); // Subscription Error: (1001): resource \"my_camel\" is unavailable\n  },\n  () => { // complete\n    // connection to the channel has been closed\n  }\n);You tries to get channel history, but policy does not allow you to read from the channel:\nrtm.channel(\"not_my_channel\").getLog().subscribe(\n  messages => {\n    console.log(messages); \n  },\n  error => {\n    console.log(error); // Subscription Error: (2): none of the given actions [\"read\"] for this resource are allowed\n  }\n);\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
